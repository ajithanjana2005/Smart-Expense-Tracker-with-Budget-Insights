Expense Tracker Project Documentation

1. Introduction

Project Title: Expense Tracker

Objective:
To create a simple and efficient tool that helps users manage their finances by allowing them to set a monthly budget, log expenses, view budget status, and generate categorized expense reports.

Why This Project?
Budget management is an essential skill for individuals and families. However, many people struggle to keep track of their expenses, which can lead to overspending and financial stress. This project addresses this problem by providing an easy-to-use application to track spending and monitor budgets effectively.

2. Implementation

Development Process:
The project was developed using Python due to its simplicity and versatility. Key programming concepts such as functions, loops, and dictionaries were used to achieve modularity and efficient data handling.

Key Features:

Set a monthly budget.

Add expenses with categories and amounts.

View total expenses and remaining budget dynamically.

Generate an expense report categorized by type.

Programming Concepts Used:

Functions:

set_budget(): To set the monthly budget.

add_expense(): To log an expense.

view_budget(): To calculate and display the total spent and remaining budget.

show_report(): To generate and display a categorized expense report.

Loops:

A while loop keeps the program running until the user chooses to exit.

A for loop is used to aggregate expenses by category.

Data Structures:

List: Stores individual expenses as tuples (category, amount).

Dictionary: Used to categorize expenses and calculate totals by category.

3. Demonstration

Step 1: Set a Budget

Input: User sets the monthly budget (e.g., ₹5000).

Step 2: Add Expenses

Input: Users log expenses by entering a category and an amount (e.g., Food: ₹500).

Step 3: View Budget Status

Output: Displays total expenses and remaining budget dynamically (e.g., Spent: ₹500, Remaining: ₹4500).

Step 4: Generate Expense Report

Output: Summarizes expenses by category (e.g., Food: ₹500, Transport: ₹300).

Example Run:

Enter your budget in INR: 5000
1. Add Expense
2. View Budget Status
3. Show Expense Report
4. Exit

Enter expense category: Food
Enter amount in INR: 500
Expense added: Food - ₹500
Choose: 2
Total Spent: ₹500
Remaining Budget: ₹4500
Choose: 3
Expense Report:
- Food: ₹500
Choose: 4
Exiting the program. Goodbye!
